A game I created within 2 hours during a hackathon at Hack Reactor.

* Yellow rectangle (cab): Transports you to a random location. You are safe during this time.
* Blue rectangle (dangerous van): Don't touch this van! Otherwise you'll die!
* Green rectangle (police): After touching this rectangle, you are safe for two seconds.
